    """Process Word and Excel files to find and update matching content.
    
    Pipeline Steps:
    1. Load and parse input files
       - Word document text extraction
       - Excel data parsing with definition names
    2. Match sentences by definition names
       - Search for exact definition matches first
       - Consider definition name variations
       - Verify temporal context (three/six months)
    3. Update matched sentences
       - Format changes using LLM
       - Preserve sentence structure
       - Update numeric values
    4. Return results with confidence scores
    
    Args:
        docx_path: Path to Word document containing text to update
        excel_path: Path to Excel file containing new values
        timeout: Timeout in seconds for LLM calls (default: 30)
        
    Returns:
        List[Tuple[str, str, float]]: List of tuples containing:
            - original: Original sentence from document
            - modified: Updated sentence with new values
            - confidence: Update confidence score (0.0-1.0)
            
    Example:
        >>> results = await process_files("report.docx", "updates.xlsx")
